# MB-400: Microsoft PowerApps + Dynamics 365 Developer
## Module 3, Lab 1 - Plug-ins

Scenario
========

A regional building department issues and tracks permits for new buildings and
updates for remodeling of existing buildings. Throughout this course you will
build applications and perform automation to enable the regional building
department to manage the permitting process. This will be an end-to-end solution
which will help you understand the overall process flow.

In this lab you will build two plugins. The first plugin will run when a new
permit record is created and it will check that there are no other permits that
exists for the build sites that are “locked”. If a locked permit is found, the
plugin will block the creation of this new permit. The second plugin will hook
up and run when the Lock Permit custom action is invoked. In the prior module we
defined the custom action, and now with the plugin step registered on execution
of the custom action, it will actually perform the lock permit business logic.

High-level lab steps
======================

As part of building the plugins, you will complete the following activities:

-   Create two plugins using a common provided base class

-   Implement logic to work with a plugin registered on an entity event

-   Implement logic to work with a plugin registered on a custom action event

-   Deploy the plugins and associate them with your solution

-   Use the plugin trace log to see traces from the plugin

-   Debug the plugin on your local computer

Things to consider before you begin
-----------------------------------

-   Do we know what events will trigger our plugins?

-   Could what we are doing with the plugin, be done using Microsoft Flow?

-   Remember to continue working in your DEVELOPMENT environment. We’ll move
    everything to production soon.

Exercise #1: Block New Permit Creation Plugin
==============================================

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create a plugin that will run on
create permit, this plugin will check if there are any locked permits for the
selected build site of the new permit and block the creation of the new permit.

Task #1: Create the plugin
---------------------------

1.  Create a Visual Studio project

    - Start **Visual Studio**.

    -  Click **File > New > Project**.

        should now be able to see the class file.

4.  Add **PluginBase** file to the project.

    -  Locate the **PluginBase** file in the lab resources folder.

    -  Drag the **PluginBase** file to your Visual Studio project. Make sure
        that the file now exists in the folder structure.

    -  Review the **PluginBase** class. This class inherits from IPlugin.

    -  Close the **PluginBase** file.

5.  Add **using statements** to the **PreOperationPermitCreate** class, make the
    class **public**, and inherit from **PuginBase**

    -  Add the using statement below to the **PreOperationPermitCreate** class.
    
```
    using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
    
    using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Query;  
    using ContosoPackagePoject;
```

6.  Make the **PreOperationPermitCreate** public and **inherit** from
    **PluginBase**.

7.  Override the ExecuteCDSPlugin method and get the Target entity and the Build
    Site entity reference.

    -  To override the **ExecuteCDSPlugin** method, add the code below to the
        **PreOperationPermitCreate** method.
```
    protected override void ExecuteCDSPlugin(LocalPluginContext localcontext)
    
    {
    
    base.ExecuteCDSPlugin(localcontext);
    
    }
```
8.  To get the **Target** entity, add the code below inside the ExecuteCDSPlugin
    method.
```
    var permitEntity = localcontext.PluginExecutionContext.InputParameters["Target"]
    as Entity;
```
9.  To get the Build Site entity reference, add the below code after
    **permitEntity** variable definition.
```
    var buildSiteRef = permitEntity["contoso_buildsite"] as EntityReference;
```
10.  To add Trace Messages, add the below mentioned code after **buildSiteRef**
    variable definition.
```
    localcontext.Trace("Primary Entity Id: " + permitEntity.Id);
    
    localcontext.Trace("Build Site Entity Id: " + buildSiteRef.Id);
```
11.  Create Fetch xml and that will get the count of locked permits matching the
    build site id and call retrieve multiple.

   -  Create the **FetchXML** string.
```
    string fetchString = "<fetch output-format='xml-platform' distinct='false'
    version='1.0' mapping='logical' aggregate='true'><entity
    name='contoso_permit'><attribute name='contoso_permitid' alias='Count'
    aggregate='count' /><filter type='and' ><condition
    attribute='contoso_buildsite' uitype='contoso_buildsite' operator='eq' value='{"
    + buildSiteRef.Id + "}'/><condition attribute='statuscode' operator='eq'
    value='463270000'/></filter></entity></fetch>";
```

12.  Call RetrieveMultiple and add Trace Message.

```
    localcontext.Trace("Calling RetrieveMultiple for locked permits");
    
    var response = localcontext.OrganizationService.RetrieveMultiple(new
    FetchExpression(fetchString));
```

13.  Get the locked Permit Count and throw InvalidPluginExecutionException if the
    **Count** is more than 0

   -  Get the locker permits **Count**.
```
    int lockedPermitCount =
    (int)((AliasedValue)response.Entities[0]["Count"]).Value;
```

14.  Add Trace Message, check if the **Count** is more than **0** and throw
    **InvalidPluginExecutionException** if it is more than **0**.
    
  ```  
    localcontext.Trace("Locket Permit count : " + lockedPermitCount);
    
    if (lockedPermitCount > 0)
    
    {
    
    throw new InvalidPluginExecutionException("Too many locked permits for build
    site");
    
    }
 ```
 
15.  Build the project and make sure it succeeds. To build the project, right
    click on the project and select **Build**. Check the output and make sure

Exercise #2: Create Custom Action Plugin
=========================================

**Objective**: In this exercise, you will create and register a plugin that will
be invoked when the lock permit custom action is used. This plugin will be used
to implement the business logic of locking the permit. Specifically, it will
update the permit to indicate it is locked and then cancel any pending
inspections.
  
**Note:** If you did not create the custom action in a prior lab, look in your
resources folder for how to add it here before you proceed.

        class.
```
    using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk;
    
    using System.Text.RegularExpressions;
    
    using ContosoPackagePoject;
    
    using Microsoft.Xrm.Sdk.Query;
```
3.  Make the **LockPermitCancelInspections** public and **inherit** from
    **PluginBase**.

4.  To override the ExecuteCDSPlugin method and get the reason value from the
    input parameter.

    -  Override the **ExecuteCDSPlugin** method. Add the code below inside the
        **LockPermitCancelInspections** method.
  ```  
    protected override void ExecuteCDSPlugin(LocalPluginContext localcontext)
    
    {
    
    base.ExecuteCDSPlugin(localcontext);
    
    }
```
5.  Get the target entity reference, entity, set status reason to lock, and
    update the permit record.

    -  Get the target **Entity Reference** and **Entity**.
```
    var permitEntityRef =
    localcontext.PluginExecutionContext.InputParameters["Target"] as
    EntityReference;
    
    Entity permitEntity = new Entity(permitEntityRef.LogicalName,
    permitEntityRef.Id);
 ```   
6.  Add **Trace** message and Set the **Status Reason** to **Lock**. 463270000
    is the lock value of the Status Reason option-set and statuscode is the name
    of the status reason field.
```
    localcontext.Trace("Updating Permit Id : " + permitEntityRef.Id);
    
    permitEntity["statuscode"] = new OptionSetValue(463270000);
```

    qe.ColumnSet = new ColumnSet("statuscode");
```
2.  Create the **ConditionExpression**.
```
    ConditionExpression condition = new ConditionExpression();
    
    condition.Operator = ConditionOperator.Equal;
    
    condition.AttributeName = "contoso_permit";
    
    condition.Values.Add(permitEntityRef.Id);
```
3.  Set the **Criteria** of the query.
```

    {
    
    }
```
7.  Retrieve the selected status reason option and check if it is set to new
    request or pending.

    -  Get the currently selected value of the **Status Reason** option-set.
        Add the code below inside the **foreach** loop.
```
    var currentValue = inspection.GetAttributeValue<OptionSetValue>("statuscode");
```
8.  Check if the selected option is **New Request** or **Pending** and increment
    the count. 1 is the value of the New Request option and 463270000 id the
    value of the Pending option. This should be placed inside the foreach loop.
```  
    if (currentValue.Value == 1 || currentValue.Value == 463270000)
    
    {
    
    canceledInspectionsCount++;
    
    }
  ```  
9.  Cancel the inspections that are pending or new request

    -  Set the **Status Reason** selected value to **Canceled**. Add the code
        below inside the if statement inside the foreach loop. Make sure that
        463270003 is the value for **Canceled Status Reason** in the
        **Inspections** entity. If this differs, please update the value with
        actual value for **Canceled Status Reason**.
