## Module 3, Lab 2 - Custom connectors

Scenario
========
A regional building department issues and tracks permits for new buildings and
updates for remodeling of existing buildings. Throughout this course you will build applications and
perform automation to enable the regional building department to manage the
permitting process. This will be an end-to-end solution which will help you
understand the overall process flow.

In this lab you will build a custom connector that can be used from PowerApps
and Microsoft Flow. Custom connectors describe existing APIs and allow them to
be used easily. In this lab, you will build an API that has common calculations
used by inspectors so that they can be used by applications. After building the
API, you will create a custom connector definition to make it available to
PowerApps and Microsoft Flow.

The connector could have multiple actions defined on it, for our lab we will
define a single action **Get Required CPM** – where CPM stands for Cubic \<N\>
Per Minute. In some regions this would be Cubic Feet Per Minute, and in others
it could be Cubic Meters Per Minute. The action we are building will take the
dimensions of a room and the number of air exchanges required by policy. The
action logic will calculate the required CPM for that configuration. If you
want, you can add additional actions to support other inspector type scenarios
to the API and the custom connector.

After building the API and the custom connector you will modify the inspector
app to add the user experience to use the connector. You will use the same
connector and invoke an action from Microsoft Flow.

High-level lab steps
======================

As part of configuring Custom Connector, you will complete the following

-   Create an Azure function that implements the CPM API

-   Create a custom connector in a solution

-   Configure the security and actions on the custom connector

-   Test the custom connector

-   Configure a PowerApps canvas app to use the connector

-   Configure a Microsoft Flow to use the connector

Things to consider before you begin
-----------------------------------

-   Is there a standard approved connector available that can be used?

-   What security will we use in our connector?

-   What are possible triggers and actions of the connector?

-   Are there any API rate limits that could potentially affect the connector?

Exercise \#1: Create the Azure Function
=======================================

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create an Azure function app and the
function that will calculate the CPM.

Task \#1: Create CPM Calculation Function
-----------------------------------------

1.  Create the function app

    -   Sign in to <https://portal.azure.com>

    -   Click **Create a Resource**.

    -   Search for **Function** and select **Function App**.

    -   Click **Create**.

    -   Enter **CPMCalculator** for **App Name**. Provide a unique name. if
        CPMFunction is not available.

    -   Create **New Resource Group**. You may select an existing Resource Group
        if you already created one for this course.

    -   Leave all other default selections and click **Create**. Wait for the
        function app to be created.

2.  Create function

    -   Select **All Resources**.

    -   Search for **CPMCalculator**.

    -   Click to open the **CPMCalculator** Azure Function App.

    -   Click **+** icon to Create New Function.

    -   Select **In-Portal** and **Click Continue**.

    -   Select **Webhook + API** and click **Create**.

3.  Add the **Using Statements** and **CRMCalcRequest** class to the function.

    -   Add the Using Statements below to the function.

			using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging;
			using Newtonsoft.Json.Linq;

	-   Add the public class below to the function. This will describe the request that will be sent from the applications using the API.

			public class CPMCalcRequest

			{
					public int Width=0;
					public int Height=0;
					public int Length=0;
					public int AirChanges=0;
			}

4.  Clean up the Run method

    -   Go to the **Run** method.

    -   Remove everything but the log line from the **Run** method.
 
5.  Get the Request body and deserialize it as **CRMCalcRequest**

    -   Get the request **Body** from the request argument. Add the code below
        inside the **Run** method.

			string requestBody = await new StreamReader(req.Body).ReadToEndAsync();

	-	Deserialize the request body. Add the code below inside the Run method.
	
			CPMCalcRequest calcReq = 
			JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<CPMCalcRequest>(requestBody);

6.  Calculate the CPM and return it form the Run method

    -   Calculate the **CPM** and log the calculated value. Add the code below
        inside the **Run** method.

			var cpm = ((calcReq.Width*calcReq.Height*calcReq.Length) * calcReq.AirChanges) / 60;
			log.LogInformation("CPM " + cpm);

	-	Return the calculated **CPM**. Add the code below inside the Run method.
	
			return (ActionResult)new OkObjectResult(new{			
				CPM = cpm
			});

7. **Save** the function.

8. Copy the Function URL.

	-   Click **Get Function URL**.

	-   Click **Copy**.

	-   Keep the **URL** you copied on a notepad. You will need this URL while
    creating the custom connector.

	-   Close the popup.

Exercise \#2: Create the Custom Connector
=========================================

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create the Custom Connector. This same
approach could be used to describe any existing API you create or that has been
created by any 3rd parties and an existing connector for that service is
unavailable.

Task \#1: Create the Custom Connector
-------------------------------------

1.  Open the Permit Management solution

    -   Sign in to <https://make.powerapps.com> and make sure you are in the
        **Dev** environment.

    -   Select **Solutions**.

    -   Click to open the **Permit Management** solution.

2.  Create Custom Connector

    -   Click **+ New**.

    -   Select **Others > Custom Connector**.

    -   Change the **Connector Name** from **Untitled** to **CPM Calculator**.

    -   Locate the **Host** field and paste the **Function URL** you copied in
        Exercise 1.

    -   Remove https:// and everything after .net.

3.  Select API key for security and create the connector

    -   Advance to **Security**.

    -   Select **API Key**.

    -   Enter **API Key** for **Parameter Label**, **code** for **Parameter
        Name**, and select **Query** for **Parameter Location**.

4.  Create Connector

    -   Advance to **Definition**.

    -   Click **Create Connector** and wait for the connector to be created.

5.  Create Action

    -   Click **New Action**. The action describes each operation that the API
        has. These can be manually defined like we are doing here or can be
        imported from Open API or Postman collection files for larger APIs.

    -   Enter **CPM Calculator** for **Summary**, **Calculates CPM** for
        **Description**, and **GetRequiredCPM** for **Operation ID**.

6.  Import request from sample

    -   Click **+ Import from Sample**.

    -   Select **Post** for **Verb**.

    -   Paste the function **URL** from your notepad and remove everything after
        **HttpTrigger1**.

    -   Paste the json below in the **Body** field and click **Import**.

			{
    			"Width": 15,
    			"Height": 8,
    			"Length":20,
    			"AirChanges":8
			}
7.  Add Default response

    -   Scroll down to the **Response** section and click **+ Add Default
        Response**.

    -   Paste the json below in the **Body** and click **Import**.
    
			{"cpm":200}

8. Test the connector

    -   Advance to Test.

    -   Click **New Connection**. This will open a New window.

    -   Go to your notepad and copy only the value of the **code** (everywhere
        after **code=**).

    -   Go back to the connector, paste the value you copied, and click Create
        Connection.

    -   Refresh the connections and selected newly created connection.

    -   Provide values for **Width**, **Height**, **Length**, and **AirChange**.

    -   Click **Test Operation**.

    -   You should get a CPM value back.

    -   Close the window and go back to Solution window and click **Done.**

    -   Select **Publish all Customizations.**

			Text(Defaulttitle.GetRequiredCPM({Width: WidthText.Text, Height:
			HeightText.Text, Length: LengthText.Text, AirChanges:
			AirChangeText.Text}).cpm)))

	-   Select the **ResultLabel** and set the **Text** value to the
    **CalculatedValue** variable.
