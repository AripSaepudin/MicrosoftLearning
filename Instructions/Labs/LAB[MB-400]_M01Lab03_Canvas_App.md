# MB-400: Microsoft PowerApps + Dynamics 365 Developer
## Module 1, Lab 3 – Data Modeling

Scenario
========

A regional building department, issues and tracks permits for new buildings and
updates for remodeling of existing buildings. Throughout this course you will
build applications and automation to enable the regional building department to
manage the permitting process. This will be an end-to-end solution which will
help you understand the overall process flow.

As we continue to build our solution, we will now design a PowerApps canvas app
that the inspectors will use in the field on their mobile devices. Canvas apps
are low code apps that can be designed for a tablet or mobile phone layouts. You
will build a two-screen canvas app that allows inspectors quickly access and
process the inspections.

High-level lab steps
======================

We will follow the below schema to design the canvas app:

-   Create the app using the tablet form factor

-   Connect to CDS as a data source

-   Configure a gallery control to show the pending inspections

-   Use a CDS view to populate the gallery

-   Configure a detail page with inspection info

-   Handle saving the inspection results to CDS

-   Export the solution with the data model and apps and import it to the
    “Production” environment

The first screen in the application will show all Pending Inspections for the
logged in Inspector. The second screen lets the inspector update the selected
Inspection.

Things to consider before you begin
-----------------------------------

-   What would an inspector need quick access to while in the field?

-   How do we move our solution from the development to the production
    environment?

-   Remember to continue working in your DEVELOPMENT environment. We’ll move
    everything to production in Exercise 2 of this lab.

Exercise \#1: Create Canvas App
===============================

**Objective:** In this exercise, you will create a canvas app.

Task \#1: Create Canvas App
---------------------------
